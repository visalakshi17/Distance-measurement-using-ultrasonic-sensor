# Distance-measurement-using-ultrasonic-sensor
This project is about measuring distances between two objects or in which one of the objects is a moving body and another object is stationary using an ultrasonic sensor. An ultrasonic sensor houses a transducer that emits high-frequency, inaudible acoustic waves in one direction when the transducer element vibrates. If the waves strike and bounce off an object, the transducer receives the echoed signal. The sensor then determines its distance from the object based on the length of time between the initial sound burst and the echo's return. Ultrasonic sensors require fairly accurate timing circuitry, so acoustic sensors really require a processor of some sort to drive them. Ultrasonic sensors should be a first choice for detecting clear objects, liquids, dense materials of any surface type (rough, smooth, shiny) and irregular shaped objects. This makes them one of the most ideal choices.
It is used in applications like car parking system, water level detection system, burglar alarm system etc.
